## Details

City Kitty is an endless runner game made in Unity using C# as part of a small hobby project, over the timespan of week or so. This game was made in collaboration with an artise who I worked closely with. The difficulty increases as the game goes on. Programming done by me.

## Build

In order to build the game, Unity 2019.4.17f1 is required. Later versions can be used but you may see unexpected results. Open the root directory as the project file, navigate to File -> Build Settings -> select your target platform and select Build/Build And Run.
